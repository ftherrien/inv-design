class SubsetWeightedRandomSampler(Sampler[int]):
    r"""Samples elements from ``indices`` with given probabilities (weights[indices]).

    Args:
        weights (sequence)   : a sequence of weights, not necessarily summing up to one
        indices (list): a list of indices to draw from 
        replacement (bool): if ``True``, samples are drawn with replacement.
            If not, they are drawn without replacement, which means that when a
            sample index is drawn for a row, it cannot be drawn again for that row.
        generator (Generator): Generator used in sampling.

    Example:
        >>> # xdoctest: +IGNORE_WANT("non-deterministic")
        >>> list(WeightedRandomSampler([0.1, 0.9, 0.4, 0.7, 3.0, 0.6], 5, replacement=True))
        [4, 4, 1, 4, 5]
        >>> list(WeightedRandomSampler([0.9, 0.4, 0.05, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1], 5, replacement=False))
